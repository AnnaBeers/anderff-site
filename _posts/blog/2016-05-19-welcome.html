Hello!
<br />
<br />
I'm Anna Beers. This is a space for me to write, keep a resume, and post some projects that I've been working on. I expect to be redesigning this site frequently in the next few weeks, so excuse me if some things look a little empty or... <em>off.</em>

You can find some more contact information in the <a name="About" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about">About</a> section in the toolbar. Soon, I will be uploading projects - data visualizations, other fun little things - in the <a name="Projects" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects">Projects</a> tab. There's an iceberg visualization from my undergrad thesis work there now. When I get around to blogging, you should be able to find those posts in the <a name="Blog" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog">Blog</a> tab. Both projects and blog posts should also appear on the front page if you are just scrolling through.
